Multibeam data of LeConte Bay seafloor from the inner fjord

These are processed multibeam sonar data from LeConte Bay, southeast Alaska. The data come from five cruises grouped into five files: 
1) Aug 1999 and Sep 2000 (20-m resolution) - 1 file; 
2) August 2016 (20-m and 4-m resolution) - 2 files; 
3) May 2017 (2-m resolution) - 1 file; 
4) Sep 2018 (2-m resolution) - 1 file.

The datasets collected in 2016-2018 originally included ice-face data, as reported in Sutherland et al., 2019 (DOI 10.1126/science.aax3528). The data presented here include only the seafloor data, exclusive of the ice face. They are referenced to WGS84, UTM zone 8 (meters easting/northing), and mean sea level. The data in 2016-2018 were collected over several days each year, and time stamps are included.
